\caption{\textbf{The AURORA Framework.} 
    \textbf{(Left) Client-Side Autonomous Alignment (Training Phase):} 
    The architecture is decoupled into three layers: the \textit{Foundation Layer} handles local task learning; the \textit{Alignment Layer} introduces global Simplex ETF anchors; and the \textit{Control Layer} serves as an autonomous regulator using meta-annealing and uncertainty-based weighting to dynamically adjust $\lambda_{eff}$ through a gradient decoupling barrier.
    \textbf{(Right) Server-Side One-shot Aggregation (Testing Phase):} 
    After local training, clients upload aligned prototypes to the server for a unified global model fusion without iterative communication.}\label{fig:method}
