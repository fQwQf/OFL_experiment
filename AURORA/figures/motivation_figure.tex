\caption{The Motivation: Visualizing the "Temporal Dichotomy" in One-Shot FL. (Left) The Failure of Static Alignment: While strictly anchoring local prototypes to a global ETF structure (large $\lambda$) prevents feature drift in the early stage, it becomes too rigid in the late stage, prohibiting necessary local adaptation and causing model collapse.
(Right) The Dynamic Need: We identify that the optimal alignment strength is time-varying. A robust system requires strong global guidance initially to fix the coordinate system, followed by autonomous relaxation (green waves) to enable fine-grained feature learning. AURORA automates this trajectory without manual tuning.}
